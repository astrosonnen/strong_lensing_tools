`make_slacs_lensing_grids.py`: on a grid of values of the total density slope (gamma), it computes, for each SLACS lens:

- The value of the mass enclosed within 5kpc (m5) that matches the Einstein radius
- The Jacobian of the variable change from m5 to the Einstein radius
- The lensing cross-section for the fiducial reference source
- The lensing cross-section for a reference source with intrinsic emission line flux equal to half of the detection limit.
