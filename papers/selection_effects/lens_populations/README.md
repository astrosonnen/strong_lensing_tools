## Lens population simulations

### Simulation description 

We simulated three different populations of galaxies, with different values of the intrinsic scatter in the stellar and dark matter mass. We labeled these simulations as 'fiducial', 'low scatter' and 'high scatter'.
For each of these galaxy populations we simulated strong lensing events with a population of background extended sources.
In the case of the fiducial scatter simulation we also produced a simulation of galaxy-quasar lenses.

`XXX_galaxies.hdf5`: file containing information on the properties of the galaxies (lenses and non-lenses). Below is a list of the datasets included in the .hdf5 file

| Dataset | Description                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| z       | Redshift                          |
| lmstar  | Log of stellar mass               |
| lreff   | Log of half-light radius (in kpc) |
| lm200   | Log of the halo mass              |
